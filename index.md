## Comptuer Science Projects

### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    The first part of Lab 6 shows me how important it is to understand the
    correct way to write and use for loops. Being an essential thing to
    understand, I feel like this lab has a clever way of checking the ability
    to correctly write a for loop, by having the programmer repeat the given
    pattern by using for loops to print each line on the terminal. Thanks to
    this assignment's creative way of checking my understanding, I feel like
    it is one of the simple yet important projects I have programmed since
    it helps solidify my understanding of C++ and its way of running things.


* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8 was my personal favorite of the 12 labs I have done during this
    semester because of part 3. I was curious as to how computers had art
    before they had graphic displays. They use ASCII art which allowed me
    to write a program that read one of these files and displayed the result
    on the terminal, which looks like a simple animation. The most important
    thing that I have learned from this, however, is that modern computers are
    very fast and the understanding of how to make the program wait before
    executing another line of code was crucial for the effect to work correctly.


* Lab 12

    I liked Lab 12 a lot because of its first part. The assignment itself
    definitely served its purpose as the final lab, which made me use everything
    I learned from the semester to correctly finish the assignment. Although
    the second part definitely practices the same theme, I feel like the first
    part does the heavy lifting here alongside being more enjoyable to code
    between the two parts in my opinion. To add, this lab is one of my personal
    favorites since it just shows how much I have learned in one semester,
    going from printing "Hello world" on a terminal to working with .gif images.
